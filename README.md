# Project 8: The Great Canadian Shore Cleanup (Team Stats)

Introduction to Project 8, with text adapted from the 2020 Vancouver Datajam Project Descriptions.

## Background

Since the middle of the 20th century, the rapidly increasing global production of
plastics (322 million per year in 2016) has been accompanied by an unprecedented accumulation of plastic litter in our oceans. On average, an estimated 8 million metric tons of this persistent material enters the global ocean annually (Jambeck et al. 2015). Plastic litter compromises the ecological and economic prosperity of the ocean, with over 300 marine species being harmed annually through entanglement or ingestion (Gall & Thompson, 2015). Microplastics are a concern to ocean health because they are ingested by marine plankton, move across food webs and like all plastic litter they can persist in the ocean for an extremely long time (hundreds of years).

With the world’s longest coastline, this problem is of particular urgency for Canadians. In recent years, plastic bans have started to be enacted at the municipal level, but the impact on behaviors and the environment can be difficult to quantify.


## Data

Since 1994, the [Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup](https://www.shorelinecleanup.ca/) has collected over 1.7 million kg of trash across Canada’s shorelines over thousands of volunteer cleanup events. This data is 'citizen science' data, meaning it is made up of observations by individual volunteer participants. This means that some entries may be more complete than others.

The main dataset for this challenge provides three years of shoreline cleanup data across Canada (2017-2019). This dataset will be shared as an Excel spreadsheet privately over email. Please clone this repo and save the spreadsheet in your local copy.

In addition, we will make use of the [Retail Council of Canada's database of single-use plastic municipal regulations](https://www.retailcouncil.org/regulations-and-bylaws-on-shopping-bags-in-canada/). This will involve some data scraping/curation to get into a usable form for analysis. 

## Challenge

Create a visualization and/or analysis that sheds light on the location and types of plastic pollution present on Canada’s beaches in recent years. Additionally, explore the relationship between municipal legislation regarding plastic waste and the types of plastics found in each location.
